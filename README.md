## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project was to build a working booking system for a fictional restaurant so that customers would have an easy way to create, update and delete their bookings on. The goal was not so much to make it visually impressive but to make it functional and easy to understand.

* First Time Visitor Goals
    * As a first time visitor I can signup to the booking system in order to in the future be able to create bookings.
    * As a first time visitor I can read the menu to see if the food is interesting and appealing.
    * As a first time visitor I can learn about the restaurant, some key information and location as well as how to get in contact via email, phone or social media.

* Returning Visitor Goals
    * As a returning visitor I can create an account so that in the future I can make my first booking
    * As a returning visitor I can check the menu to see if there are any specials or if the menu has changed.

* Frequent User Goals
    * As a frequent user I can login to manage already existing bookings.
    * As a frequent user I can find my current bookings.

By assigning user stories to common issues and taking advantage of the GitHub Kanban board and its features, the process of making sure that everything that was needed was included in the project in order to make a user friendly and accesible.
