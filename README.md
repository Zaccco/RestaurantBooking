# Sushi Restaurant

<img src="./static/images/am_i_responsive.png">

The goal for this project was to create a fictional sushi restaurant with a functional booking system, a menu, and some other information about the restaurant. The user can signup to be able to make bookings to the restaurant with some key information such as: what time they want to book the table, how many guests and if they have any allergies, special requests etc.
